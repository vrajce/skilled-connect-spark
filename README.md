# üöÄ Skilled Connect Spark

Welcome to the **Skilled Connect Spark** project repository! This project is primarily written in **TypeScript** and includes some **PLpgSQL** and **CSS**.

## üìú Project Description

SkilledConnect is an innovative web application designed to connect users with skilled professionals and small-scale service providers for various needs. Unlike existing delivery or convenience apps (e.g., Swiggy, Blinkit), this platform focuses on professionals like plumbers, electricians, mehendi artists, and other small-scale service providers, enabling them to showcase their skills and get rated based on their performance. The platform is built to empower local businesses and individuals by providing them with opportunities to grow while offering users an easy and efficient way to access these services.

2. **Service Provider Profiles:**
   - Skilled professionals can create a profile with their experience, portfolio, pricing, and availability.
   - Display ratings and reviews from previous customers.

4. **Payment and Invoicing:**
   - Secure online payments (UPI, card, or wallet integration).
   - Generate invoices for transparency and record-keeping.

5. **Rating and Feedback System:**
   - Users rate service providers after each task.

6. **Push Notifications and Updates:**
   - Users are notified about the availability of nearby professionals.
   - Promotions or discounts for popular services.

7. **Small-Scale Business Support:**
   - Dedicated section for small-scale businesses (tailors, mehendi artists, and home-service ventures) to promote their services.
